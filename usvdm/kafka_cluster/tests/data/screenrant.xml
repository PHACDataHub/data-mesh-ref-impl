Contains SPOILERS for Yellowjackets season 2!</span><a href="https://screenrant.com/tag/yellowjackets/">Yellowjackets</a> </em></strong>season 2 has already answered a few big questions, including how the girls descend into cannibalism, but now theories have exploded about what happens to Shauna&#39;s baby. At seven months along, Shauna (Sophie N&eacute;lisse) could technically have the baby at any time, which presents a terrifying situation in a season already full of thrills, including the girls tearing into Jackie&#39;s (Ella Purnell) corpse after it&#39;s been smoked over a bonfire. With no sign of being rescued, the temperatures dropping, and tensions rising, winter in the Ontario wilderness isn&#39;t exactly the best environment for the Yellowjackets to welcome a baby into.</p>

The couple, who had been together since 2011, divorced after nearly 5 years of marriage in 2022. While they planned to keep their split amicable, Tom has had some other priorities and ended up breaking Katie&#39;s trust by making out with fellow <em>Vanderpump Rules </em>cast member Raquel Leviss. This was the least of Raquel&#39;s problems, especially after the reveal of her <a href="https://screenrant.com/tom-raquel-vanderpump-rules-cheating-scandal-explained/">long-term affair with castmate Tom Sandoval</a>, but it did cause a huge rift in Katie&#39;s friendship with her ex-husband.</p>

That film showed glimpses at a wide world of assassins on the fringes of society, including the mysterious hotel The Continental run by Winston (Ian McShane), which operates on a currency of gold coins and offers refuge to members of the community.</p>

The <em>Transformers</em> franchise will continue to cycle through franchise-leading human characters with its seventh entry. <em>Transformers: Rise of the Beasts</em> continues the franchise in a 1994 setting that features Anthony Ramos and Dominique Fishback as the main human actors. They are joined by new Transformers factions in the Maximals, Predacons, and Terrorcons, but some familiarity will remain thanks to Optimus Prime and Bumblebee still leading the Autobots.</p>

The aptly named &quot;<em>Scandoval</em>&quot; <a href="https://screenrant.com/tom-raquel-vanderpump-rules-cheating-scandal-explained/">affair between Tom and Raquel</a> became public knowledge this March, when Tom&#39;s phone fell out of his pocket during his band&#39;s gig and grabbed by his now-ex Ariana Madix. On Tom&#39;s phone, Ariana saw undeniable proof of the deception Tom and Raquel had created. After nine years together, Ariana abruptly ended her relationship with Tom.</p>

Crowley, a human-turned-demon and formerly the King of the Crossroads, played a crucial role in <em>Supernatural</em>, but he will always be remembered for the nicknames he gave the Winchester brothers. The reason behind Crowley calling the Winchesters Moose and Squirrel is an interesting one, and ties into the show&rsquo;s overarching narrative, and explains the trio&rsquo;s long-standing relationship.</p>

Catherine Hardwicke&#39;s new film <em><strong>Mafia Mamma</strong></em> is one such title, and it certainly leans into the silliness of its central conceit. In some ways, it&#39;s like wish fulfillment for anyone who has felt severely underappreciated in life, provided they don&#39;t mind some illegal activities. Even when it gets too slight for its own good, <em>Mafia Mamma</em> keeps things moving along at a brisk, entertaining pace that pushes its flaws to the wayside. Led by a delightful Toni Collette, this is one wild ride.</p>

While the MCU is the first thing that comes to mind to most moviegoers when it comes to Marvel, some Marvel movies that are not in the MCU &mdash; Sony&#39;s live-action expansion with Spider-Man-related characters &mdash; release in the coming years, and 2024 will see how well Sony&#39;s Marvel universe can sustain itself with lesser known characters. Sony&#39;s Spider-Man Universe has released three movies so far, with Tom Hardy&#39;s Venom franchise proving itself a success with audiences.</p>

The actors have since appeared alongside one another in projects like the <em>Jay &amp; Silent Bob</em> movies, Ridley Scott&rsquo;s <em>The Last Duel</em>, and the Affleck-directed 2023 sports drama <em>Air</em>.</p>

Like any sitcom reboot, Netflix&rsquo;s <em>That &lsquo;90s Show </em>needed to change up some details of <em>That &lsquo;70s Show</em>&rsquo;s canon. The reboot depicted Kelso and Jackie (re-)married with children, but one star of <em>That &lsquo;70s Show</em> correctly noted that this didn&rsquo;t quite add up.

Kubrick deliberately didn&#39;t explain <em>The Shining</em>&#39;s ending during the film, but he did, however, later explain why Jack Torrance appears in <em>The Shining</em> picture at the end. Based on the book of the same name by Stephen King, <a href="https://screenrant.com/shining-movie-jack-torrance-nicholson-actors-almost-cast/"><em>The Shining</em> follows Jack Torrance (Jack Nicholson)</a>, an aspiring writer and recovering alcoholic who takes a job as the off-season caretaker of the Overlook Hotel. Jack takes his wife, Wendy (Shelley Duvall), and their son, Danny (Danny Lloyd), with him, but little do they know, the Overlook has some dark secrets of its own. Triggered by Danny&rsquo;s psychic abilities, the hotel releases some dangerous supernatural forces that mess with Jack&rsquo;s sanity &mdash; and the safety of Wendy and Danny.</p>

After the <em>Fast &amp; Furious</em> franchise first got its start back in 2001, <em>Fast X</em> will serve as the penultimate installment, pitting Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel) and his crew against a new villain in the form of Jason Momoa&#39;s Dante. Leterrier has already revealed that the sequel will go back to the franchise&#39;s street racing roots in some ways but now teases that there will be one big difference.</p>

Contains SPOILERS for Beef on Netflix!</span>The season finale of Netflix&#39;s <a href="https://screenrant.com/tag/beef-netflix/"><strong><em>Beef</em></strong></a> brought the show to a new surrealist territory, specifically with its opening scene of two crows talking to each other about Amy and Danny. One of the crows remembers Danny for feeding him once, while the other recalls that Amy scared its uncle when she pointed a gun at it after Danny shockingly urinated on Amy&#39;s bathroom floor. The crows comically hold a vote to declare Amy&#39;s offense as an act of war, cawing in agreement that she is now one of their enemies. Other brief moments in Beef that include crows allude to broader themes that contribute to season 1&#39;s narrative.</p>

Led by Meredith Grey (Ellen Pompeo), <em>Grey&rsquo;s Anatomy</em> follows the lives of surgical interns, residents, and attendings at Grey Sloan Memorial Hospital (originally Seattle Grace Hospitals) as they do their best to juggle their personal and professional lives, making way for a lot of drama inside and outside the hospital.</p>

In 2008, <em>Spaced </em>joined a long list of beloved UK sitcoms to receive the dubious honor of being remade for American audiences. While <em>The Office</em>&#39;s U.S. remake became a massive hit for network NBC, most U.S. remakes of UK sitcoms don&#39;t fair quite so well. One of the things that <em>The Office </em>remake had going for it was the involvement of creators Ricky Gervais and Stephen Merchant, something that was apparently not done for Fox&#39;s <em>Spaced </em>remake.</p>

Marvel Studios spent over a decade building up to the events of <em>Avengers: Infinity War</em> and <em>Avengers: Endgame</em>, with every project from 2008&#39;s <em>Iron Man</em> onwards informing the dramatic storyline that unfolded over the Russo Brothers&#39; two-part Infinity Saga spectacular. The Phase 3 films neatly wrapped up many storylines, specifically those involving the six original members of the Avengers, but <em>Endgame</em> also set the stage for the onset of the Multiverse Saga and left a lot up to audience interpretation.</p>

As such, it&#39;s no surprise that he runs into a few enemies and Plaga-infested nuisances along the way. However, the <em>RE4</em> remake&#39;s most annoying changes not only make the journey frustrating from a narrative perspective, but also gameplay-wise.</p>

The Padawan never got to graduate from his apprenticeship status before Order 66, and was forced to live in exile until being discovered by Inquisitors. In contrast, Luke studied under two of the most talented Jedi Masters, became the de facto Grand Master after defeating the Empire, and was part of the strongest force-wielding lineage ever. Indeed, Cal&#39;s achievements seem insignificant when placed beside those of Luke&#39;s. But <em>Jedi: Survivor</em>&#39;s new town hub feature will show that Cal is a truer Jedi than Luke even if he isn&#39;t as powerful or accomplished.</p>

It&rsquo;s bitterly ironic for the man who was almost single-handedly responsible for obliterating the Mandalorian race to then model his look after them. Despite admiring and studying their culture, Gideon still persecuted and hated the Mandalorians for their strength. Up till now, it seemed like it wasn&rsquo;t in Gideon&rsquo;s character to try and emulate others, especially given the fact that he adamantly denounces Thrawn&#39;s return in <em>The Mandalorian</em> season 3, episode 7. Nevertheless, his donning of Mandalorian-inspired armor reveals a deeper longing of his that has finally surfaced.</p>

Keeley and Roy&#39;s relationship was a central storyline for the first two seasons of <em>Ted Lasso</em>, but it was really in season 2 that the show explored how great they were together. The reveal in <em>Ted Lasso</em> season 3&#39;s premiere that Roy and Keeley broke up created questions about what the future held for the couple. But since their relationship was so strong before and <em>Ted Lasso</em> is ending with this season, there has been an expectation that the series will explore how the two characters find their way back together.</p>

Callum Wharry played the youngest son of Cersei Lannister until the role of Tommen was recast with Dean-Charles Chapman for season 4. Tommen emerged as the heir to the Iron Throne shortly afterward, but the pressures of his family and the surrounding tension among Westerosi powers eventually got the best of the young king. Tommen&#39;s death came in episode 10 of season 6, and is one of the most tragic ends for a <em>Game of Thrones </em>character.</p>

Strictly speaking, a body-swap movie is one where there is an exchange between two people. However, the term is also applied to movies where characters become a different (usually older or younger) version of themselves. They provide actors with the opportunity to play completely against type - and, often, against age or gender. While there&#39;s usually plenty of wackiness and hi-jinks in body-swap comedies, there are also frequently moments of real tenderness and emotion.</p>
