# [Part V - Looking forward with hindsight](#part-iv)

## The Playground
 
1. The Players
    * The PTs
        1. They provide *knowledge of their unique landscapes in primary care and public health* governance, including policies, data standards, processes, workflows, ecosystems, technical challenges, ability constraints, and preferred outcomes.
        2. Collaborate with builders to *define unique properties and requirements for their synthetic patient population*.
        3. *Experiment with governance policies* to enable federated analytics on the synthetic population and extract results.
    * Surveillance Programs
        1. Experience *real-time, up-to-the-minute* statistics and analysis.
        2. Observe significant changes in surveillance capabilities with *fully dynamically customizable data flows*.
        3. Provide advice and observe the impact of *real-time responses to threats*.
    * Researchers
        1. Access and *combine inputs from multiple surveillance* programs.
        2. Conduct deep, *population-level queries while adhering to privacy protections*.
    * Key Stakeholders
        1. Receive *automated daily briefs* on key indicators.
        2. Maintain *real-time situational awareness* with multi-domain analysis and suggested actions.
2. The Sandbox
    * Generate *~40 million Canadian synthetic patient* profiles, mirroring socio-economic and medical demographics.
        1. Customize based on properties suggested by PTs.
    * Include other datasets and knowledge graphs as applicable.
3. Toys: Analytics Platforms
    * Thirteen PT- and one Federal Analytics Platform, accessible with authentication and attribute-based control.
    * Hosted in managed clouds, based on Paradire PoC
        1. Includes continuous development, testing, and integration.
    * Features include CI/CD, fully automated operations, real-time monitoring, data governance compliance, high-availability across multiple locations and cloud vendors, and disaster recovery.
4. Builders: PHAC DMIA
    * Responsible for the development and maintenance of the Maple Flow Health Data Playground.
5. Timeline:
    * Setup: Q1/2024
    * Playtime: Q2-Q4/2024
    * Review: Q1/2025
 
## The Benefits

The concept of a Playground as described involves *a collaborative, data-driven environment focused on primary care, public health governance, surveillance, and research*. It would serve as a *critical test environment for innovation, learning, and real-world application* in healthcare.
 
1. Innovative Test Environment for Healthcare Solutions
    * The playground offers a unique opportunity for builders and stakeholders to develop and test healthcare solutions in a simulated yet realistic environment.
    * This is crucial for validating concepts before they are implemented in real-world scenarios.
2. Enhanced Understanding of Healthcare Needs
    * Builders gain invaluable insights into the specific needs and challenges of the healthcare sector, including primary care and public health governance.
    * This understanding is critical for developing solutions that are finely tuned to the actual demands of the healthcare system.
3. Risk Mitigation and Proof of Concept
    * By testing in a controlled environment, the risk associated with implementing new technologies and policies in the actual healthcare system is significantly reduced.
    * This environment allows for thorough vetting of ideas, providing a strong proof of concept before real-world deployment.
4. Collaborative Learning and Co-creation
    * The playground fosters a collaborative space where builders and players (such as PTs, researchers, and surveillance programs) can work together.
    * This co-creation process ensures that the developed solutions are more aligned with user needs and are more likely to be successful in practice.
5. Advanced Surveillance Capabilities
    * Real-time, up-to-the-minute statistics and dynamic data flows enhance surveillance programs.
    * This allows for timely detection of public health threats and the ability to monitor the impact of interventions in real-time.
6. Accelerating Healthcare Innovation
    * The playground can significantly accelerate the pace of innovation in healthcare by providing a space where ideas can be rapidly developed, tested, and refined.
7. Preparation for Real-World Application
    * Players get to test and refine their approaches in a safe environment, which is a crucial step towards ensuring that these solutions can be seamlessly transitioned into real-world applications.
8. Data-Driven Insights and Improved Public Health Responses
    * With real-time data and analytics, the playground enables a deeper understanding of public health trends and the effectiveness of various interventions, leading to improved public health strategies and responses.
9. Economic Efficiency and Potential Cost Savings
    * By identifying effective solutions and policies before full-scale implementation, the playground can lead to significant cost savings in the long run.
    * Avoiding the deployment of ineffective or suboptimal solutions in the actual healthcare system can save resources.
10. Enhancing Canada’s Position in Healthcare Innovation
    * This project positions Canada as a leader in healthcare innovation and digital health solutions, enhancing the country's reputation in the global healthcare community.

*The Playground is not just a technical solution but a strategic investment in the future of healthcare with the potential to revolutionize how healthcare challenges are addressed and solutions are developed.*
